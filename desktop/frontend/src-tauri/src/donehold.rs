// Dones held until the work they report is over.
//
// An agent's Stop fires at every turn boundary, and a boundary is not always the
// end of the work. Claude starts the next turn by itself when a background shell
// it waits on exits, when a teammate or background sub-agent reports back, or
// when a task notification was already due — sometimes 40 ms after the Stop.
// Codex carries on with a /goal's next turn, or past a Stop another hook
// blocked, with no hook at all. Announced at once, each of those is an "Agent
// finished" chime, banner and phone push while the work goes on, and another
// when it ends. So a Done waits here, the tab keeping what it showed, until
// nothing that could still continue the work is left:
//
// - a short grace, for a next turn that was already due;
// - sub-agents and teammates still working (agentchildren.rs);
// - a sub-agent's open question (statusask.rs);
// - a background shell the turn started, which wakes the session when it
//   exits (bgtasks.rs). A dev server or a watcher never exits, so a shell that
//   looks like one, one already running when the user last sent a prompt, and
//   one still running after WAIT_CAP settle the turn as before;
// - for a prompt queued behind the turn, and for Codex, the pane still drawing.
//
// Any newer report from the agent drops the held Done: the next turn speaks for
// the session, and its own Stop reports the finish.
