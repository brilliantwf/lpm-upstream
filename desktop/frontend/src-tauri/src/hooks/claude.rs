/// it", empty when nothing is in flight. Non-empty -> re-assert Running and let
/// the real Done land on the turn that ends with nothing pending.
///
/// Three entry kinds are NOT a pause. A `teammate` (an in-process teammate
/// agent): the harness leaves it registered with `status: "running"` for the
/// whole session and tracks liveness in a separate `isIdle` flag that it never
/// serializes into the hook payload, so an idle teammate is byte-identical to a
/// working one. A `monitor` (a wake-on-event watch): publishing an Artifact
/// auto-arms a persistent ambient comment watcher (`timeout_ms: 0`, status
/// `running` forever) that rides in every later Stop payload, so any session
/// that published an artifact would otherwise pin on Running for good; a
/// deliberate Monitor watch is a wake-later signal like `session_crons`, which
/// have never held Running either. And a `shell` (a backgrounded Bash command):
/// nothing is thinking while it runs — the harness's own transcript calls the
/// turn done and merely notes "1 shell still running" — and its exit, like a
/// monitor firing, starts a fresh turn whose own hooks re-assert Running and
/// land a Done of their own. The payload carries no start time and no hint of
/// what the command is, so a dev server or job worker an agent deliberately
/// leaves running for the user's manual test is indistinguishable from a build
/// it expects to be woken by — and the server never exits. A turn that ends
/// with nothing but teammates, monitors and shells in flight is a real finish,
/// and treating it as a pause pinned tabs on Running for hours — every later
/// Stop re-reported the same value, which dedups away in status.rs and so never
/// healed. These are therefore the only types that can be downgraded, and only
/// on POSITIVE evidence. Claude's own housekeeping — a `dream` (memory
/// consolidation), an `auto-mode scan`, a `memory import` — joins them: it is
/// ambient work that finishes without ever waking the session, so a Running it
/// held up stayed until the next prompt.
///
/// JSON escapes `"` inside strings but leaves `{`, `}` and `[`, `]` raw, so no
/// check on the shape of a naively cut array body can tell "the array closed"
/// from "a `description` mentioned a bracket" — a teammate description holding
/// `}]` would cut the body mid-entry, balance its own braces, and hide a live
/// workflow behind the cut. The scan therefore tokenizes before it slices:
/// `s/\\./Z/g` collapses every escape, after which a `"` can only be a real
/// string delimiter; the ignorable `"type"` forms (`teammate`, `monitor`,
/// `shell`) collapse to `T` and every other type to `X`; and `s/"[^"]*"/Q/g`
/// blanks what is left of every string — a shell's `command` included, so a
/// command line that quotes a task type is text like any other. The
/// survivors are pure structure, so `${f%%]*}` now cuts at the array's own close
/// and the counts mean what they say: as many objects as `{`, as many `T` as
/// objects, no `X`, no stray `[` (a nested array would cut early). A body that
/// fails any of those — a foreign or future type, an unparsable shape — keeps
/// Running, which is today's behavior.
///
/// Unlike `claude_sid_cmd` this needs several reads of the payload, so stdin
/// is slurped once into `$p` instead of streamed through `sed`. The extractions
/// lean on a greedy `.*`, which anchors to the LAST occurrence: prose fields
/// (`last_assistant_message`) serialize before `background_tasks` and so cannot
/// hijack the branch by quoting it. Cutting at the array's close likewise keeps
/// `session_crons` — which serializes after, and whose `prompt` is arbitrary
/// user text — out of the type scan. A payload with no `background_tasks` at all
