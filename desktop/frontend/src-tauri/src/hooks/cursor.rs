// Cursor CLI (cursor-agent): lpm's hooks in ~/.cursor/hooks.json.
//
// Cursor hands a hook its payload as a heredoc appended to the command
// (`<command> <<'CURSOR_HOOK_EOF'`), which binds to the command's last simple
// command — and a trailing comment would swallow it, leaving the payload's line
// to run as shell. So each hook is one `sh -c '…'` whose stdin is the payload,
// with the marker inside the quoted script. Only observational events are
// used: Cursor reads empty output from a permission hook as no opinion, but lpm
// has no business near those decisions. Its CLI asks for approvals without
// firing any hook, so a Cursor tab never shows Waiting.
